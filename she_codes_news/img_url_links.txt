Tiramisu

Italy’s best-loved dessert, Tiramisu (literally meaning ‘pick me up’) was named for its energising layers of marsala-soaked sponge, creamy mascarpone and coffee—interesting, considering we’d argue that most of us know it today as the last nail in the food-coma coffin brought on by an Italian feast. Either way, we'd never say no to a good one.

And luckily, we’ve no shortage of spots to sink our teeth into its mushy layers here in Perth, either—from the most traditional of recipes to the most contemporary, plates of tiramisu dot our city north to south.



Pappagallo
We know you might have stuffed your face on the amazing food at Pappagallo, but trust us—you’ll want to save room for the sweeties. In particular, their dreamy tiramisu, whipped up with mascarpone cheese and coffee.   

Ciao Italia 
This place is little Italy to a tee—complete with red and white checked tablecloths, Italian waiters shouting across the room, melodious tarantella music and of course, the all-important tiramisu lauded by many as ‘the best ever’. We don’t know about that, but Ciao Italia's tiramisu definitely has the thickest layers of mascarpone ever, plus a generous drizzling of chocolate sauce and cream on top… too much? Never.
